        <h2>My Songwriting Style</h2>
        <p>My approach to songwriting is rooted in storytelling, with a blend of folk, rock, and indie influences. I believe music has the power to move people, to make them laugh, cry, and reflect. I draw inspiration from personal experiences, history, and the everyday struggles and triumphs we all face.</p>
